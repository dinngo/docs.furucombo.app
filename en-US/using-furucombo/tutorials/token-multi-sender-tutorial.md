This guide is to help you understand the utility and how to set up the Multi-Send cube on [Furucombo](https://furucombo.app/). The Multi-Send cube on [Furucombo](https://furucombo.app/) allows you to send a token to multiple addresses. This can be useful to pay members of a DAO or transfer your tokens out of a wallet to diversify risk. If you are more of a visual learner, you can follow our [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/v4FkR\_d-h6A) instead.

#### Steps to set up the Multi-Send cube:

1. The Multi-Send cube is available on any network. To start, goto the [create mode on Furucombo](https://furucombo.app/combo)

2. Next, click the cube in the center, and add ‘Multi-Send’ located under the utility section

3. Now you can decide what tokens you wish to send to which addresses. Note that you can only send one token per multi-send, but you can send it to as many addresses as required. For example, if I wish to send Aave tokens to 4 different addresses, I need to switch the input to Aave, add the ENS or Addresses in the multi-send cube, and add the amount of tokens I wish to send.

* Additionally, you can import the .CSV list of addresses to automatically populate the address list.&#x20;
* To import the list, include the addresses and the token amounts like in the following example formula: “0x64d95F6B4a8d01953894fC7D87833cf8372a08eD, 150”. We recommend you always double-check these addresses to ensure you are sending your tokens to the correct one.

4. Once you have added all the addresses and token amounts, you can choose to save these to your address history, which is stored on your local drive and only available for you to see.

* These addresses and token amounts can also be adjusted by clicking the expand icon on the right beside the trash icon. There you can adjust the parameters, or change the name of the saved imported wallets and set.
