# Fiat to Crypto on Furucombo Tutorial

You can now purchase crypto directly from the [Furucombo](https://furucombo.app/) interface with your fiat or credit card! This tutorial will guide you through the process in order to perform this transaction.

### &#x20;How to Make a Purchase:

1. To get started, goto the [Create Page](https://furucombo.app/combo) on Furucombo.
2. Next, at the top left, you’ll see a button called ‘Buy Crypto’. Click this to open the Transak interface.

3. Next you’ll be greeted with the buy crypto to your wallet page where you can select how much you want to pay, and in what currency, the payment method (card payment, apple pay, or google pay), the estimated amount will you receive, and the network you will receive these tokens on. We recommend using a network that’s supported on Furucombo, and that has low fees (such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, or Fantom). Once you are happy with your selections, click ‘Buy Now’.

4. At the next screen you’ll need to enter your wallet address for the token you’re transferring. Additionally, the order details are provided with the total amount of tokens you’ll receive, and the amount you need to pay with the fees. Once you enter your address (double check you have used the correct address and that there are no errors), click ‘Buy {Token}’.
