Furucombo Fund is a strategy hub that organizes investment opportunities in the DeFi space, and allows you to invest in popular platforms across the ecosystem. It is a very easy to use intuitive platform which allows even the most basic users to reap the benefits of farming and decentralized finance.&#x20;

## **Fund Introduction**

Fund is our fund management system. Anyone can create a fund, where experienced fund managers will be in control of creating combos to maximize the return on investment. This allows for more diversification in investments, and allows experts to manage your funds. Fund managers are incentivized through a management fee, and/or a performance fee which is dependant on the parameters of the fund.
