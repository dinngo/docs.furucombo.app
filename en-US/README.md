# ðŸ¤“ Furucombo Introduction

Furucombo simplifies complex DeFi (Decentralized Finance) strategies through a user-friendly platform. Leveraging [Protocolink and the Lending SDK](https://protocolink.com/) as its backbone, Furucombo empowers users to:

* **Craft Multi-Step DeFi Strategies:** [Furucombo Create](https://furucombo.app/combo) integrates popular DeFi protocols via [Protocolink](https://protocolink.com/). This allows users to seamlessly combine different DeFi actions into a single transaction. Imagine borrowing from one protocol, swapping tokens on another, and then depositing your earnings into a third â€“ all in one go! This streamlines the process and enhances security compared to executing these steps individually.
* **Effortlessly Manage Borrowing and Lending:** [The Lending Dashboard](https://furucombo.app/lending) provides a clear and intuitive interface to view and manage your positions across various lending protocols. Built on top of [Protocolink](https://protocolink.com/), the Lending SDK unlocks powerful position management strategies. With just a few clicks on the Lending Dashboard, you can execute actions like collateral swaps, debt swaps, leverage positions, or deleverage them â€“ all facilitated by flash loans.

By combining these functionalities, Furucombo positions itself as a valuable tool for both DeFi beginners and experienced users seeking to optimize their strategies.
